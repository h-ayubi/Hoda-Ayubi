## 💼 Hoda Ayubi - Personal Portfolio

🔹 Theme & Inspiration
This is a minimal, user-friendly, and clear single-page portfolio website, designed to reflect professionalism while maintaining a creative edge.
The inspiration came from modern personal websites of leading web designers, especially their clean blog layouts and elegant typography.


The color palette was carefully selected using Coolors.co to ensure a visually pleasant and cohesive design.


##🔹 Key Features & Design Decisions
✅ Minimalist Design: Clean layout with plenty of white space for better readability and focus.

✅ Single Page Layout.

✅ Smooth Scrolling: Enhanced user journey with gentle transitions between sections.

✅ Typography:

Anton for bold main headings

Noto Sans Arabic for modern subheadings

Segoe UI, Tahoma, and other system fonts for easy-to-read body text

✅ Hover Effects & SVG Animations: Subtle interactivity without being overwhelming.

✅ Responsive Design: Fully functional on all screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.

✅ Accessible & Clear UI: Prioritized readability, color contrast, and intuitive navigation.

##🔹 Challenges Overcome
One of the biggest challenges was ensuring responsive design across different devices.
Some elements initially broke on smaller screens. Through careful use of flexbox, media queries, and layout restructuring, these issues were resolved to ensure consistent display.

##🔹 Built With
🖥️ HTML5

🎨 CSS (Flexbox & Media Queries)
